Welcome to the Advanced Test Driven Development with Mocking workshop.

## Setting Up Your Workstation

If you are going to use your laptop as a workstation, you will want to install the following software:

1. Docker.  Available for most major operating systems.
1. A programming editor.  VS-Code and Atom are excellent GUI choices.  You may also choose `vi` or `emacs` if your religion dictates.

## Programming Language

We'll be working in C++ today, with the build managed by CMake, and tests managed by [Google Test](https://github.com/google/googletest).

C++ is popular for embedded programming, and is particularly easy to mock.  At each stage of the workshop, syntax and concepts you need will be introduced with examples, so that even if you are not familiar with the language you should have no problem following along.
